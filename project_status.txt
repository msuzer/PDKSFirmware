Context handoff – ESP32-S3 project

Hardware:
- Custom board using ESP32-S3 module marked N16R8
- Peripherals: MFRC522 (SPI), W5500 (SPI), DS3231 RTC (I2C), OLED (I2C), SD card, relay, LED, buzzer
- UART logging only (no native USB usage)

Software / Tooling:
- PlatformIO + ESP-IDF (Arduino NOT used)
- Custom PlatformIO board JSON in /boards

Project status:
- Build and boot are stable
- RTOS running
- I2C bus working (RTC + OLED confirmed)
- SPI bus shared, manual CS control implemented
- All CS pins (MFRC522, W5500, etc.) initialized HIGH at boot
- MFRC522 works ok, no bug.
- integrated RFID → access control logic

next tasks:
- WiFi stack init
- W5500 driver
- Send 
- Camera Support for picture taking on card read
- SD-Card driver + filesystem for logging user access through rfid tag

Goal:
- on RFID card read, log to cloud service via WiFi or Ethernet
- log to local storage (sd-card) simultanously (decide: log local storage all the time or only when cloud not available)
- when cloud/net available, update cloud from local storage
- provide routes for log retrieval from remote host
